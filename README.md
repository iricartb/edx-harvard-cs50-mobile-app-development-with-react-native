<h1>CS50's Mobile App Dev. React Native</h1>

<h2>Course description</h2>

This course picks up where CS50 leaves off, transitioning from web development to mobile app development with React Native.<br><br>
The course introduces you to modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. Through hands-on projects, you'll gain experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course culminates in a final project for which you'll implement an app entirely of your own design.
