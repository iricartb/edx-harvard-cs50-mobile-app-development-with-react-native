<h1>CS50's Mobile App Dev. React Native</h1>

<h2>Course description</h2>

This course picks up where CS50 leaves off, transitioning from web development to mobile app development with React Native.<br><br>
The course introduces you to modern JavaScript (including ES6 and ES7) as well as to JSX, a JavaScript extension. Through hands-on projects, you'll gain experience with React and its paradigms, app architecture, and user interfaces. The course culminates in a final project for which you'll implement an app entirely of your own design.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>PROJECT 0 - TODO App</h3>
The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and its paradigms by creating a TODO app. This app should be able to add TODOs and track the number of total TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs.

<h3>PROJECT 1 - Pomodoro Timer</h3>
For this project, you'll be implementing a Pomodoro timer. This timer will help people trying to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.or/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).<br><br>
It will vibrate to tell you when to take breaks or resume working, based on some determined values.
